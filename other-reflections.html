          10 Skills Reflections
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          During the 10 Skills in 10 Days activity, I tried to pick up how the speakers 
          succeeded and how they got where they were. From Noah Washington, I learned 
          not to be afraid of losing money and that in the early stages, it is bound to 
          happen along with the fact that not everything has to be set in stone and it’s 
          ok to be fluid. Cat Hutchings taught me that even if you are not executing everything, 
          you can still have a good business by being the visionary and having an implementer. Lisa
          Chiles talks about how it’s important to dress for occasions, not just always being professional 
          by knowing the audience and what they’re wearing too. Ethan Martinez showed me the importance of 
          unexpected friendships and how they can help you professionally too. During the teamwork day, I
          learned how to effectively communicate with others without words along with concise methodologies. 
          From Laura Easley I learned that one bad decision isn’t the end of the world and that even if something
          bad happens, you wouldn’t be who you are without it, making me less self-conscious when I make a bad
          decision. She also taught me how different personality types solved tasks differently and had different
          expectations. Ms. Wieser taught me how it is important to have different kinds of people
          on a team to ensure you have different perspectives and points of view. Edwin Ortiz taught me that taking 
          is important to take advantage of new opportunities and see how to capitalize on life 
          changes. He also taught us that a problem has many solutions that you can do to solve it. Elena 
          Haskins taught me about reverse engineering, which is a good way to think about a problem and make 
          solutions. My favourite one of them all, Brian Clark, taught me about a lot of things, but something that 
          stuck with me was when he was talking about listening and said something along the lines of, “When you 
          listen, don’t think of what you’re going to say next while they are talking,” because that interferes with how 
          well you listen to them. Overall, the 10 Skills was very helpful and I am glad that we had the opportunity to
          hear from these amazing business professionals.

        <h2>
          Supply Chain Management Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          Dr. Thomas, a Supply Chain Management professor, first taught us 
          some of the terminology used in the supply chain, later moving into 
          the processes of how it works. She explained how now more than ever
          the world is looking more deeply into the supply chain after the 
          COVID-19 pandemic. I learned how the supply chain is not straightforward 
          but rather requires a ton of communication, understanding, and harmony. 
          Before this, I thought that there were very few jobs in the supply chain due 
          to its simplism, but that misconception was clearing, showing a vast requirement
          of different people with different backgrounds to properly run it. <br><br>

          The game we played helped me understand the supply chain very well. In this game, 
          there were raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retail stores, transportation agents,
          and customers. The raw material suppliers sold the bricks, which the manufacturer used
          to make a product, which was bought by the retail store and sold to customers.  In between
          all these, a transportation agent was required to transport goods. My partner, Rishi, and
          I were the manufacturers, and we had to buy the bricks from the raw material supplier, make
          them into a product then sold to retail stores. I learned a lot about bulk sales and loyalty,
          which helped us make more money, but beyond this straightforward path, there were defects 
          from the way they were built to the material that was used. We eventually found out where 
          the defects stemmed from to resolve it. For example, when we had a material defect, we used 
          the loyalty we built with the raw material supplier to get new, undefective parts for no cost
          except transportation fees. <br><br>

          This experience overall improved my knowledge of the supply chain in its intricacies while also
          getting me hands-on with understanding what kind of problems may arise on a smaller scale. This was
          similair to Vivek Choudaha and Sunthar Subramanian's "Beyond Automation: Regenerative AI's Impact on
          Retail Jobs" which reassured the fact that it may take some jobs but not all. This gave me more insights
          into what jobs would be removed from AI and why.

          NWA Tech Summit Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          The NWA Tech Summit was extremely helpful in learning more about the tech field from its
          abundance of opportunities like booths with local and national companies, keynote speakers, 
          and breakout rooms with more knowledge to learn. This was an amazing opportunity to learn about
          the future of the tech field, which is prominent everywhere. <br><br>

          One person I talked to was named Usman Ahsan, a business and marketing developer at Bops, a company that
          creates a lot of technology for the supply chains of big companies like Walmart. He explained some technologies
          already being used in the supply chain, like how Amazon uses dark warehousing, a method in which the warehouse is
          completely dark since there are no people in it but rather all automated technologies. I had never thought this
          could happen since I assumed technology would need light to see the product. While there may 
          be minimal light, this would save a lot on the light bill and employee payroll. I also talked to the representatives of Ritter
          Communication. This local company offers wi-fi and Internet, where I asked how it was difficult to compete with the 
          big companies like Verison or AT&T, and he responded by saying they used the fact that they were local to their advantage 
          by advertising that, which is what sets them apart from other big companies. This shows me the extent to which people value 
          local places over big companies because while I still don't understand passing up a better deal, I understand that it can
          work with the right advertisement. I also talked to the representative at Metova where we talked about AI. Since I have a 
          research paper draft on AI, we were able to have an insightful conversation. We talked about where AI may take jobs, like in storefronts, but it won't replace more technical jobs and how it will probably create a lot more jobs in the AI field to perfect it. 
          <br><br>
          I also listened in on a lot of the speakers. One of them was moderated by Bill Akins, executive director of the Chick-fil-A franchise 
          where they talked about "AI and the Evolving Retail Workforce." There they explained some of the ways AI is coming into the workforce,
          which I noted to research later to use for my paper. Overall, this was a great networking opportunity where I met many interesting people
          who gave me many insights on the latest technology, ideas, and controversies.
