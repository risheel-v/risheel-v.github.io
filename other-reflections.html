          10 Skills Reflections
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          During the 10 Skills in 10 Days activity, I tried to pick up how the speakers 
          succeeded and how they got where they were. From Noah Washington, I learned 
          not to be afraid of losing money and that in the early stages, it is bound to 
          happen along with the fact that not everything has to be set in stone and it’s 
          ok to be fluid. Cat Hutchings taught me that even if you are not executing everything, 
          you can still have a good business by being the visionary and having an implementer. Lisa
          Chiles talks about how it’s important to dress for occasions, not just always being professional 
          by knowing the audience and what they’re wearing too. Ethan Martinez showed me the importance of 
          unexpected friendships and how they can help you professionally too. During the teamwork day, I
          learned how to effectively communicate with others without words along with concise methodologies. 
          From Laura Easley I learned that one bad decision isn’t the end of the world and that even if something
          bad happens, you wouldn’t be who you are without it, making me less self-conscious when I make a bad
          decision. She also taught me how different personality types had different ways of solving tasks 
          and expectations. Ms. Wieser taught me how it is important to have different kinds of people
          on a team to ensure you have different perspectives and points of view. Edwin Ortiz taught me that taking 
          is important to take advantage of new opportunities and see how you can capitalize on life 
          changes. He also taught us that a problem has many solutions that you can do to solve it. Elena 
          Haskins taught me about reverse engineering, which is a very good way to think about a problem and make 
          solutions. My favourite one of them all, Brian Clark, taught me about a lot of things, but something that 
          stuck with me was when he was talking about listening and said something along the lines of, “When you 
          listen, don’t think of what you’re going to say next while they are talking,” because that interferes with how 
          well you listen to them. Overall, the 10 Skills was very helpful and I am glad that we had the opportunity to
          hear from these amazing business professionals.

        <h2>
          Escape Room Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          Going to the NWA Escape Room with all my friends was not only a fun, but also an 
          educational experience. We communicated well with each other when we 
          verbalized what tasks we were trying to work on, so that when someone 
          else found a clue, they understood who to give it to based on the puzzle
          someone was trying to solve. We did not communicate as well when it came 
          to asking for help. Sometimes we would get caught up in trying to solve the
          puzzle ourselves that we never asked anyone for help, which would have severely
          decreased the time it took to escape. When we had multiple people working on 
          one thing, there were disagreements on who should physically try to open the 
          container, and what I learned is that it is good to let them do those because it
          makes them feel good that they could solve it while avoiding conflict. I felt
          like my main role was not only to find the clues but also to decode it like I had
          to read the star maps, but I also went and helped everyone with what they needed. 
          The most challenging puzzle we had was the star map because we had no clue what to
          do, but what we did is we had 2 people working on it at all times, and when one person
          thought of something, the other person would help them without question and trust that
          they know what they are doing. We didn’t have any specific strategies, we chose
          to keep an open mind and try to think outside the box. I don’t feel like we tried to 
          manage the time even though we were on a time limit, we are more focused on getting as 
          much done as we could. We did feel like we wouldn’t have enough time when over half 
          of the time was taken and we had finished only a quarter of the room. I felt underutilized 
          when I was on a puzzle that I was stuck on because I felt like I could be doing more, 
          but when I eventually solved it. I think our team’s key success was being able to divide
          the work properly and not just having everyone on one thing every time. I realized that it
          was good that I didn’t give up and I tried again. I learned a lot about how people think 
          about the kind of attention they want and how they want to work, which I will bring to my 
          project team to ensure we work together well.

        <h2>
          Supply Chain Management Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          Dr. Thomas, a Supply Chain Management professor, first taught us 
          some of the terminology used in the supply chain, later moving into 
          the processes of how it works. She explained how now more than ever
          the world is looking more deeply into the supply chain after the 
          COVID-19 pandemic. I learned how the supply chain is not straightforward 
          but rather requires a ton of communication, understanding, and harmony. 
          Before this, I thought that there were very few jobs in the supply chain due 
          to its simplism, but that misconception was clearing, showing a vast requirement
          of different people with different backgrounds to properly run it. <br><br>

          The game we played helped me understand the supply chain very well. In this game, 
          there were raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retail stores, transportation agents,
          and customers. The raw material suppliers sold the bricks, which the manufacturer used
          to make a product, which was bought by the retail store and sold to customers.  In between
          all these, a transportation agent was required to transport goods. My partner, Rishi, and
          I were the manufacturers, and we had to buy the bricks from the raw material supplier, make
          them into a product then sold to retail stores. I learned a lot about bulk sales and loyalty,
          which helped us make more money, but beyond this straightforward path, there were defects 
          from the way they were built to the material that was used. We eventually found out where 
          the defects stemmed from to resolve it. For example, when we had a material defect, we used 
          the loyalty we built with the raw material supplier to get new, undefective parts for no cost
          except transportation fees. <br><br>

          This experience overall improved my knowledge of the supply chain in its intricacies while also
          getting me hands-on with understanding what kind of problems may arise on a smaller scale.

          NWA Tech Summit Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          The NWA Tech Summit was extremely helpful in learning more about the tech field from its
          abundance of opportunities like booths with local and national companies, keynote speakers, 
          and breakout rooms with more knowledge to learn. This was an amazing opportunity to learn about
          the future of the tech field, which is prominent everywhere. <br><br>

          One person I talked to was named Usman Ahsan, a Business and Marketing Developer at Bops, a company that
          creates a lot of the technology for supply chains of big companies like Walmart. He explained some technologies that
          are already being used in the supply chain, like how Amazon is using dark warehousing, a method in which the warehouse is
          completely dark since there are no people in it but rather all automated technologies.
