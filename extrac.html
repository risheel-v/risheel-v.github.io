<summary>Actus Wealth Strategies</summary>
<p>
Since May 2025, I have been a junior associate at a corporate financial advisory firm, Actus Wealth Strategies. 
I work under the Chief Investment Officer, where he first taught me technical analysis, following : indicators, chart shapes, 
and trend lines. I already learned fundamental analysis, using future outlook and a company's resources
<br><br>

Because of this, the financial advisor taught me how to research advancements in technology and
inventions through many factors that we can use to find specific companies: balance sheets, funding
opportunities, future visions, leadership, etc. <br><br>
  
Apart from investing, he taught me how to budget, present, read body language, give off positive
body language, convince people, and other interpersonal skills. This internship gave me insight into the intricacies 
of the stock market and research-based investing, rather than using feelings or listening to 
someone else. I also learned how to be a better presenter and professional in any environment.

<summary>Edward Jones Intern</summary>
<p>
From January 2025 to May 2025, I was an intern for a financial consultancy group, Edward Jones. 
I interned under a personal financial advisor who first asked us to use AI agents to predict future
long-term market trends and which public companies to invest in. After creating these agents, we realised that
they are great as scrapers for information, but it was out of our scope, time, and resources to
have them predict which companies would grow from the data. <br><br>

<summary>FRI Marketing Intern</summary>

FRI Marketing is a food brokerage company that specialises in helping local and international companies
put their products into different stores, especially Wal-Mart. They have tons of clients who have been
put into Wal-Mart stores with hundreds of thousands in revenue. <br><br>

My job was to create a new website that looks better and has another section that requires a login
code for other brokerage companies that, with the founder's permission, can see a list of 
companies that are better suited for stores outside of the reach of FRI Marketing, while still
retaining a commission. I also have to make a plan to ensure that FRI Marketing can retain its
clients from being poached without getting a commission. I have to figure out the paperwork, contracts,
financials, and overall execution plan for this new implementation. My next project is creating a CRM
for FRI Marketing to track their clients efficiently.

<summary>Skylight Homes Intern</summary>

Skylight Homes is a land development company currently focused on residential homes, but is also breaking
into commercial building, apartments, and storage centres. They currently build around Bentonville and Centerton
Arkansas, but are also working on expansion plans to break into other areas.<br><br>

I first looked for ways to improve the website through wording and design, then I communicated with the international
company that runs the Skylight Homes website to get these changes implemented. After this, I worked on their backlogs of 
accounting entries that needed to be put into QuickBooks. While doing this, I also went to sponsored events where I would
stay at the company table to raise awareness for Skylight Homes and try to get people to consider a new home. I do research
for the company too, for example, when they need a new software to manage construction sites, I research which ones would be best.

<summary>AI's Effects on the Job Market</summary>
<p>
In 2023, I started a research paper on the effects that the development of AI may 
have on the job market over the next decade. I used scholarly sources to find 
quantitative data to make predictions on what may happen in the future to make predictions
along with finding expert testimony to back up these findings. From this, I found that 
while AI may take some jobs, it is more likely to take the jobs most people not only don't want
but also that are not being filled. While there are some jobs that AI is going to take which
people want, it will create a lot more jobs than it takes. Beyond this, when interviewing higher-ups
at Walmart, they said that they are more focused on sparking innovation, meaning they are likely to
move those people to a different field. When talking to another AI specialist, he said while AI can take
jobs if we want to remove the bottom line, most companies make money from innovation, so it is more likely
that those people will be moved to different jobs. This means that it is likely AI will cause some disruption,
but the evidence points to the fact that more jobs will be created than taken by AI, meaning that we will have
to consider new ways to educate students about new and obsolete career opportunities in the future. <br><br>

<summary>Effects of Increasing the Minimum Wage</summary>
<p>
In 2024, I started a research paper on the effects of increasing the federal minimum wage in the 
United States on the cost of living and how it would affect those in lower-class households.
I used the same skills I learned from my first paper and found that increasing the minimum wage
would severely increase prices, as it has historically, but since companies have higher costs, they will
likely cause unemployment. Since people of lower-class households tend to have less stable forms for 
attendance and travel, for example, their car not working or other problems that could be solved by 
having higher quality things, they are likely to be the first ones to be unemployed. That paired with 
the increased prices may overall make the living conditions of the lower class worse, while making those who
still keep their jobs and are just above the poverty line have worse lives too. My recommended solution to 
decrease the effects of this was to have federal programs to help those who are struggling. Rather than
increasing taxes, we could disband obsolete government programs. I found a source that showed government 
programs back in the late 1900s that were obsolete and how much funding they take; we could 
use the funding from these programs and reallocate them to help those in need.<br><br>

I scored in the top 1% out of 1.6 million people in the nation on a standardized test called the PSAT, which most juniors in high school 
took. This test has a reading and writing, and math section with 2 modules for each one. To advance to the finalist stage, which I am trying to do,
I have to send an application to show my leadership skills and other academic excellence. I have to submit an essay, show 6 different activities/extracurriculars,
show 2 awards, and any paid work I am doing. I am currently on track to become a finalist.

<summary>DECA (11th Internationally)</summary>
<p>
In 2025, I placed 11th at the DECA International Leadership Conference in my event, Hospitality and Services
Team Decision Making. In this event, we are given a case study, 
then have 30 minutes with no technology or notes to develop a solution off the top of 
our heads, while also including a list of important 
business questions called "performance indicators." These can range from "What is the
importance of patronage?" to "What is the nature of promotion in a service business?" 
while putting it all in the context of the case. We have 15 minutes to present this to a judge
immediately after the 30 minutes.

<summary>HOSA (1st in State)</summary>
<p>
In 2023, I placed 1st place at the Arkansas HOSA State Leadership Conference, 
qualifying me for the International Leadership Conference. I competed in the HOSA Bowl
where here, we had a quiz bowl-style event where I was with 3 other people, and the
questions could be anything from stuff about the specifics of HOSA, medical terminology,
insurance, parliamentary procedure, and many more medical-related topics. 
Being at this conference, I got great networking
opportunities, but I feel that beyond this, being in diverse clubs has given me 
an idea of the interests and values of different people in different careers.
This will help me in the future because I can understand and resonate
with others outside of the business field, which is an essential aspect of business.

<summary>FBLA (3rd in State)</summary>
<p>
In 2023, my team and I won 3rd place at the FBLA Arkansas State Leadership Conference
for the Marketing event. In this, we competed against teams all over the state by first
doing a test, and then, when we placed in the top 20, we had a case study. In this, we were given 
our situation 30 minutes before we had to present it to a judge. We had to solve the problem given 
in the situation based on the background information and role-play a presentation to a judge who also
role-plays a position of power. This took us to the FBLA National Leadership Conference, where we got
great networking opportunities and interactive workshops.

<summary>VEX Robotics (Second in International Division)</summary>
<p>
In 2022, my team and I tied for first place in our division but lost the tiebreaker
due to a battery issue. Being in robotics taught me not only about engineering
but problem-solving as a whole and since it is very difficult to do all the 
robotics tasks (more information in the "VEX Robotics" leadership section) on your own, 
it taught me a lot about teamwork and communication, beyond the hard engineering and
tech skills. I also learned how to write and document concisely because we had
to document the engineering process.

</section>

<details class="left-aligned-details">
<summary>Microsoft Excel Specialist</summary>
<p>
Through Certiport, I got the Microsoft Excel Specialist Associate certification. Through studying
for this, I learned many useful Excel formulas along with amazing ways to organize large data sets
which has helped me with my projects in school, for clubs, for client projects, and personal data 
management. 
</p>
</details>

<details class="left-aligned-details">
<summary>Microsoft PowerPoint Specialist</summary>
<p>
Through Certiport, I got the Microsoft PowerPoint Specialist Associate certification. The material 
I learned this has helped me convey information in a concise, elaborate, clear, and well-designed manner. 
I've used this in client projects, club meeting slides, and recruitment presentations.
</p>
</details>

<details class="left-aligned-details">
<summary>Microsoft Word Specialist</summary>
<p>
Through Certiport, I got the Microsoft Word Specialist Associate certification. The contents of learning
Word helped me with the formal business report during the Grand Savings Bank project (more information in 
the project reflections tab) and I plan on using Word for the research papers I am working on.
</p>
</details>


<details class="left-aligned-details">
<summary>Entrepreneurship and Small Business</summary>
<p>
Through Certiport, I got the Entrepreneurship and Small Business certification. From this, I learned 
many business terms that will be used when I go into the workplace. Some of these include financial analysis, 
lean canvas business plans, parts of a pitch deck, parts of a full business plan, parts of an elevator
pitch, and many more which have overall taught me the parts of starting a small business and how to keep 
it running. I can also apply this in bigger companies by looking at problems on a micro-scale with the concepts I learned
and then using the rest of my knowledge about the company to look at the problems on a macro scale. This will also
help me when I am reading a business plan or looking at a pitch, I will know what to look for, what is probably included, 
and where to find it.
</p>
</details>

<details class="left-aligned-details">
<summary>Python</summary>
<p>
I got my Python certification through Certiport and finished a Python basics certification through Coursera. In the Certiport
course, I learned the overall concepts of basic Python functions, list basics, and iteration. The Coursera certification had a
focus on indexing, dictionaries, and more in-depth iteration.
</p>
</details>

<details class="left-aligned-details">
<summary>Computational Thinking</summary>
<p>
This Certiport certification is a part of computer science but is not attached to any language. This certification tests your 
problem-solving with pseudo-code, asking what this program may do, or when asked about a program, creating the pseudo-code. This
shows the skills required to solve a problem with code rather than the meaning of the code functions.
