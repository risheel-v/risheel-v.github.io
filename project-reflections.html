          Walmart vs. Amazon Project Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
            The purpose of the Walmart vs. Amazon project was to predict 
          who would dominate the retail face by 2040, Walmart, Amazon, or
          an unexpected 3rd party. My role was to research innovation but 
          I feel like we all took on many roles. Like, Sarah was the one
          who did the slide designs and I felt like I took charge but I 
          should’ve stepped back a bit, and even though I feel like what 
          I said or did wasn’t wrong, there were much better ways of 
          handling situations. We were mainly hindered by the communication
          aspect, for example, we did not accurately communicate how much 
          time each person should spend on their slides during the presentation.
          For example, Sarah and I made a SWOT analysis the day before
          presenting without communicating this to Rithvik or Charlie. I applied
          what I learned from the 10 Skills in 10 Days, mainly from the slide 
          designs of the people presenting along with how to speak clearly and 
          accurately. I used credible data, which I learned to identify from my 
          AP Seminar class, which is a class that purely focuses on research. I 
          think we had a good analysis based on our time. We could have improved 
          the slide designs a bit but none of us spoke up except for Sarah because
          she mainly had that creative touch. I learned that I need to sometimes 
          step back and let people solve things for themselves rather than telling
          them what to do not only because they have to learn but because they will
          feel better about themselves. This will help me succeed because I 
          understand how to work with people who care about projects, in contrast to 
          school, where people tend to make me do everything only for the grade. This
          is something I will not only apply for future projects but something that I wish 
          to apply in my entire life.

        <h2>
          Grand Savings Bank Project Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          In this project, my team and I had to figure out a way to get Grand Savings 
          Bank from an 18% Gen-Z rate to 25%. We all worked on the ideation but after
          that, my main job was financial analysis. The skills I had to apply were my 
          mathematical skills along with my skills in Excel. We decided to create an 
          extremely good kids' checking account as our main product, as long as a student
          account was predicted to bring a lot less revenue but with easier implementation.
          The kid's account, on the other hand, was planned to increase the parent's 
          interest rate, have an interest rate higher than the competition, and offer a free 
          personal finance class while mainly being pushed by the employees to the parents of 
          existing members. The main hardship within the team was which benefits would be 
          worth the cost of being implemented by bringing more customers which would overall
          lose us money. The personal struggle I had with this project was by the time we 
          figured out the features we wanted in the accounts, I did not have much time to do 
          the financial analysis, and my teammates, no disrespect to them were great to 
          work with, were unable to help me on the financial analysis due to it being higher
          level math with the percentages, the prediction, and the ability to apply math in 
          a real-world situation.
