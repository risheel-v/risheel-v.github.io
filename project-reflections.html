          Walmart vs. Amazon Project Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
            The purpose of the Walmart vs. Amazon project was to predict 
          who would dominate the retail face by 2040, Walmart, Amazon, or
          an unexpected 3rd party. My role was to research innovation but 
          I feel like we all took on many roles. Like, Sarah was the one
          who did the slide designs and I felt like I took charge but I 
          should’ve stepped back a bit, and even though I feel like what 
          I said or did wasn’t wrong, there were much better ways of 
          handling situations. We were mainly hindered by the communication
          aspect, for example, we did not accurately communicate how much 
          time each person should spend on their slides during the presentation.
          For example, Sarah and I made a SWOT analysis the day before
          presenting without communicating this to Rithvik or Charlie. I applied
          what I learned from the 10 Skills in 10 Days, mainly from the slide 
          designs of the people presenting along with how to speak clearly and 
          accurately. I used credible data, which I learned to identify from my 
          AP Seminar class, which is a class that purely focuses on research. I 
          think we had a good analysis based on our time. We could have improved 
          the slide designs a bit but none of us spoke up except for Sarah because
          she mainly had that creative touch. I learned that I need to sometimes 
          step back and let people solve things for themselves rather than telling
          them what to do not only because they have to learn but because they will
          feel better about themselves. This will help me succeed because I 
          understand how to work with people who care about projects, in contrast to 
          school, where people tend to make me do everything only for the grade. This
          is something I will not only apply for future projects but something that I wish 
          to apply in my entire life.

        <h2>
          Grand Savings Bank Project Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
          In this project, my team and I had to figure out a way to get Grand Savings 
          Bank from an 18% Gen-Z rate to 25%. We all worked on the ideation but after
          that, my main job was financial analysis. The skills I had to apply were my 
          mathematical skills along with my skills in Excel. We decided to create an 
          extremely good kids' checking account as our main product, as long as a student
          account was predicted to bring a lot less revenue but with easier implementation.
          The kid's account, on the other hand, was planned to increase the parent's 
          interest rate, have an interest rate higher than the competition, and offer a free 
          personal finance class while mainly being pushed by the employees to the parents of 
          existing members. The main hardship within the team was which benefits would be 
          worth the cost of being implemented by bringing more customers which would overall
          lose us money. The personal struggle I had with this project was by the time we 
          figured out the features we wanted in the accounts, I did not have much time to do 
          the financial analysis, and my teammates, no disrespect to them were great to 
          work with, were unable to help me on the financial analysis due to it being higher
          level math with the percentages, the prediction, and the ability to apply math in 
          a real-world situation. <br> <br>
          We had to apply our creativity and decision-making skills as a
          team during this project. Still, I had to mainly use my mathematical skills, which I enjoyed 
          because I love math. It felt very fulfilling to apply what I've been learning for so 
          long, do what I enjoy, and apply it to a real business situation and then see the
          result unfold. I am also really interested in research, having taken a research class
          in the past with 3 unpublished research papers, which I was able to apply to this 
          project, knowing what to look for in my information, like getting it from the Bureau of 
          Labor and Statistics and the United States Census. While we could have further analyzed our 
          predictions for the social media campaign, it was not our main revenue maker, but we still 
          wanted to have a baseline of what we may bring in, so after finding our information, we
          decided to underestimate it.  <br> <br>
          While we did not win the project, it was very fun to work on and my team was great to work 
          with. I learned from this to be more open-minded, like when we should have increased the 
          parent's interest rate, I assumed that would be a lot of money even though it was a small 
          percentage, but after doing my research and running the numbers, I realized it was not as 
          much as I thought, which taught me I need to do my research on all ideas because I am still
          not a profession with a deep understanding of how everything works. After doing this project,
          I learned that I enjoy finances and while I never thought of it as a career option
          before, I may consider it now.

        <h2>
          Grand Savings Bank Project Reflection
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font=arial narrow;">
         During this project, we were given a set of data on an Excel sheet that 
          had information on the issues reported to Toshiba by clients and during 
          the developmental phase, but we focused on only the ones reported by the
          clients. Each issue included a variety of descriptions, but we focused on
          the date submitted, who reported it, who it was directed to, the issue's
          age, its developmental stage, and the product. We had to use this information
          to make graphs and charts on a series of questions that they asked, for 
          example, they asked us to make a graph sorted by date with only open/working
          issues reported to the Base Software Development team using only issues
          reported by the client. In addition, we had to come up with our key performance
          indicator on what Toshiba may need to look into to have fewer issues overall.
          We used PivotTables in Excel, which was difficult because none of us had ever 
          done this, and because of this, we all had a very similar role in the beginning. 
          <br><br>
          When we first started to sort the data, I tried sorting it using Excel shortcuts, 
          like the "sort" button, then used the automatic graph creator to make the graph. 
          This took a lot longer and was less reliable than using a PivotTable, which Will 
          first learned how to use then taught us all. Once we knew how to sort the data, 
          the main issue was analyzing it. I have a decent tech background, so I was able to
          understand what the data meant and also teach my teammates what it meant. Raina and
          Daniel was focused on how we could put it into a presentation, where they came up 
          with an idea to give a potential cause and a potential solution to each graph. While
          we were all new to this and not experts, our collective teamwork and dedication helped
          us understand this and contributed to our success. 
          <br><br>
          I learned so much from this project, especially about Excel. When we learned how to use PivotTables,
          we were able to accurately and conveniently filter the data rather than organizing it by hand. 
          Additionally, when there was a problem, we were able to fix it quickly rather than having to redo 
          the entire data. This has taught me a lot about data analytics and how I feel that this is important
          because, in a big company, not everyone knows everything. For example, if someone has only been in 
          the company for a year, but wanted to solve a problem from 3 years back, someone who has been working 
          there for a while may already know the story behind the issue, but the newer person can use the data 
          to understand the story and what happened on a deeper level than can be expressed simply with words
          and observations.
